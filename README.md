# Choose Your Own GPT

Choose Your Own GPT is a seemingly analog device without any screens or visible digital elements. Spinning the physical dials to select characters and a story setting and then hitting the large arcade 'go' button, the built in printer will spit out a Choose your own Adventure type story on the built in receipt printer. 


## Features

- Built in 58mm thermal printer to dispense stories on demand
- Designed to be printable on 200mm^2 3D Printers
- Top dials can be snapped off of main PCB to allow modification to any size
- Optional 4th dial can be added to increase story objects or add an aditional element (talk like a pirate, etc) setting
- Support for e-ink display (untested)

## Installation

Download the arduino code and install the below libraries before compiling. You will need to visit api.openai.com and register for your own API key which does not need to be added to the code before upload, it can be set on the internal webserver. 

Once powered on, connect to the ```GPT In a Box``` Wi-Fi network. Add your API key and modify your dial labels (if desired) and connect to your Wi-Fi network.
